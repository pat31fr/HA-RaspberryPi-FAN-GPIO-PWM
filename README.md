# Home Assistant Raspberry Pi Fan GPIO PWM custom integration

## About

This project is a fork of the original [RedMeKool](https://github.com/RedMeKool/HA-Raspberry-pi-GPIO-PWM) project
which I modified in order to detect the entity as a fan rather than as a light.

**This is a spin-off from the original Home Assistant integration which was marked as deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant Core 2022.4.**

The rpi_fan_gpio_pwm platform allows to control multiple fans using pulse-width modulation. It supports FANs driven by GPIOs of a Raspberry Pi (same host or remote)
For controlling the GPIOs, the platform connects to the pigpio-daemon (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html), which must be running. On Raspbian Jessie 2016-05-10 or newer the pigpio library is already included. On other operating systems it needs to be installed first (see installation instructions: https://github.com/soldag/python-pwmled#installation).

For Home Assistant this daemon can be installed as an add-on (https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons/tree/master/pigpio).

## Installation

### HACS

The recommend way to install `ha-rpi_fan_gpio_pwm` is through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

### Manual installation

Copy the `ha-rpi_fan_gpio_pwm` folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the `ha-rpi_fan_gpio_pwm` folder and all of its contents into it.

## Configuration
To enable this platform, add the following lines to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fan:
  - platform: rpi_fan_gpio_pwm
    fans:
      - name: RPI Cooling Fan
        pin: 17
```

## CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
- **fans** list *(REQUIRED)*: Can contain multiple FANs.

- **name** string *(REQUIRED)*: The name of the FAN.

- **pin** integer *(REQUIRED)*: The pin connected to the FAN as a list.

- **unique_id** string *(optional)*: The unique ID for this fan.

- **host** string *(optional, default: localhost)*: The remote host address for the GPIO driver.

- **port** integer *(optional, default: 8888)*: The port on which the GPIO driver is listening.
